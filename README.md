# PSEUDO CODE
Header
Search bar and a submit button. Input Country by two letter country code in the search bar.

A list of Holiday's for that country will appear.

With that list of countries you will have the option to learn more or save (radio button?) that country.
Saving the country will add it to your local storage so you can refresh the page and it will appear in your favorites bar on the bottom of the page.

"Learn More" will pull the wikipedia description for that holiday. Printed inside of the Div that is the holiday.
